<h1 align='center'>Linked List</h1>
<p>Linked list data structure is use to organize that data when we want to work with an unknown number of data values. The linked list is a linear data structure that contains a sequence of elements such that each element links to its next element in the sequence. Each element in a linked list is called "Node".</p>
<p>It includes a series of connected nodes. In which each node store the data and the address of the next node.</p>

<p>You have to start somewhere, so we give the address of the first node a special name called HEAD. Also, the last node in the linked list can be identified because its next portion points to NULL.</p>
<h2>Types of Linked List</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Singly Linked List</b>: can be traversed only in forward direction.</li>
  <li><b>Doubly Linked List</b>: can be traversed in forward and backward directions.</li>
  <li><b>Circular Singly Linked List</b>: Last element contains link to the first element as next.</li>
  <li><b>Circular Doubly Linked List</b>: Last element contains link to the first element as next and the first element contains link of the last element as previous.</li>
</ul>
